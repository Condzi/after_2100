# **Current Tasks**
* move matrix calculation to separate function in the entity manager
    * update it only when necessary
* player should rotate towards player cursor
    * add some delay / smoothing, maybe this will give some better "feeling" of
    controlling a spacecraft
* figure out eliptic orbits / orbiting

* default allocator unit test
    * probably will look like bitset UT
