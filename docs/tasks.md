# **Current Tasks**
* spend time on refactor and bugfixing!!!
    * adapt the code to use `con_check` with handing of failures if `con_assert` is too harsh.
        * all "core" utilities (`sprint`, allocators) should use `con_assert`, because we're using them in the `con_check`.

* improve path rendering. fix the bug.
----
## **other**
* default allocator unit test
    * probably will look like bitset UT
