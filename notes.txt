RichText:
{
Load text -> parse tokens (nested are valid, like: "_#Im italic and bold#_") -> make correct sf::Text, in correct order,
then update parameters ("You have {} bucks!" -> "You have 0 bucks!")

limited by Rectangle_Shape -> have to fit text in it, or split it to more screens / rectangles that can be showed later.
margin_left, _right, _top, bottom

Rich_Text.show(time_between_letters)
Rich_Text.show_all()
Rich_Text.parse();
Rich_Text.update_parameters(value, position.x, position.y, etc)

Syntax:
#bold#
_italic_
regular
{} ~ parameters
\n - newline hint (if it'll be in the middle of the textbox then it won'y affect anything, but if at the end then it'll move text to
 the new line )

}


Dialog system - make a small utility that replaces text with #loc ids when done

make camera follow the path so we'll be able to make small cinematics
