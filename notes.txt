derive from Rich_Text???
Dialog_Box:
{
}

Button:
{
Label + panel ?
}

Dialog system - make a small utility that replaces text with #loc ids when done

Diagnostics:
report_and_break -> substr operation takes too long
use vector since unqiue_id in signals is counting from 0. unordered_map seems to be slow.
