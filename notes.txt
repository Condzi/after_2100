Player health, game over scene
sound effects for low health?

Player force shield that aquaiers one or more hits

the current fix for moving window is not so great. we need to find another way to fix it, i'll just delete the code for fix.
update: it looks like the only fix for that is moving the evnet loop to another thread (sic!)

Sprite3D could be a bottleneck. Maybe simple vertices would do the job?

Add save files and save locale too (pl or en).

From profiling:
 * try to make signal::emit calls all at once
 * rendering is taking 90% of the runtime. 
 * we are making too much missiles! there is no need to spawn them if player mirror sprite is offscreen.
