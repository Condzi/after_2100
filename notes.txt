!* spawning problem - it should be done before update() - add spawning queue or something. now it causes 
bugs with shooting - areas are in same position and it detects collision, where in next frame there are in
correct postions.
x* areas are in 0,0 position for a frame. figure out why
* better names for nodes (especially hitbox's names are inconsistent)
* figure out where deal damage (in which hitbox signal?)
* in Signal::bond() use Node* instead Node& because we always have to deref the pointer which is 
  boilerplate

Session 2:
* Missiles, health, explosions:
    * missile shooter and timed missile shooter nodes.
* partciles maybe now or later (decide?)
* make input binding be easy to change?
x* debug overseer with flags    

==========
Session 1:
x* Area2D => 1 Shape (Circle / Rectangle)
x* Update in Root?
x* move beggining of lambdas ('[]()') to new line for cleaner formatting
