add moving by wsad+e in menus

add resolution options and fullscreen / borderless mode
    1280x720
    1366x768
    1600x900
    1920x1080

round collider seems to have problems? sometimes it doesn't detect the collision

move locale change options to main menu because it'll crash the game in dialog mode

fix camera when entering level. sometimes it's not rotated correctly

Player force shield that aquaiers one or more hits

the current fix for moving window is not so great. we need to find another way to fix it, i'll just delete the code for fix.
update: it looks like the only fix for that is moving the evnet loop to another thread (sic!)

Sprite3D could be a bottleneck. Maybe simple vertices would do the job?

Add save files and save locale too (pl or en).

From profiling:
 * try to make signal::emit calls all at once
 * we are making too much missiles! there is no need to spawn them if player mirror sprite is offscreen.
 * exploded_sprite seems to be a hiccup
