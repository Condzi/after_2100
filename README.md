# Some kind of game.
Check out the releases for playable versions. Last one (V1) is just me experimenting with idea of orbits. The versions before it is some kind of classic shut'em up. The 'tests' were not used in the legacy branch.
# Tech
C++ + SFML (legacy branch), C++ + OpenGL (master branch). Code should compile using Visual Studio 2019. 

# Keys
WSAD - moving, Space - Shooting, E - next dialog, WS - select dialog; F1 - debug console (type 'help' for help).

# Other
It's not my best code, but my only 'almost finished' project, so I've decided to publish it. I've recorded some developement journals / snapshots showcasing the progress. You can find them [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1SApEM6FunMLT9K9q7jTvGar-0ndn4PQ)
